CLRS, the Bible in Lisp, Perl, Python and Go languages

Most Lisp and Perl codes were written more than ten years ago.  They are ideal
for a 'learn-by-doing' person self-studying the CLRS.

To run test scripts, type like this:
	sbcl --script test/test-insertion-sort.cl
	perl test/test_insertion_sort.pl
	python test/test_insertion_sort.py
	go run test/test_insertion_sort.go
